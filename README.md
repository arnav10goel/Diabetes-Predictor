# Diabetes-Predictor

## Data Pre-processing
We use the dataset provided which has 8 variables about a person i.e. Pregnancies,Glucose,BloodPressure,SkinThickness,Insulin,BMI,DiabetesPedigreeFunction,Age. It then gives a binary outcome about whether or not that person is suffering from Diabetes.

## Using Logistic Regression
We split the data and use 20% of it to train our Logistic Regression Model and then use the 80% of the remaining data to test our results. We then demonstrate the results using a confusion matrix.

This project was done as a part of the course - Introduction to Intelligent Systems (Winter 2021).
